- Working on delivering a talk on Design smells and SOLID principles.  This talk has really helped me organize my thoughts around abstraction, polymorphism, dependencies, and dependency injection.  I think I still need to clean up around single responsibility, but I'm hopeful that will come in time.
- I have a working copy of Human vs. Human and Human vs. Random Choice CPU.
