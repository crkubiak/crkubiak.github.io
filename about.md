Hola,

This blog is part of an ongoing development project for my software crafting apprenticeship at [8th Light](https://www.8thlight.com/).  I will continue to post daily updates that will mostly consist of notes, videos, tutorials, and cats.  I will also be completing assigned technical blog posts as they come down the pipe.  I will attempt to reward anyone that has suffered through one of my blog posts by paying the cat tax at the bottom.

Check out some of my friends on the IG:
